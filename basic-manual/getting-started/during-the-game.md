## Saves

Emulators bring a very useful feature : the **save state.** 

A saved state is a **quick save** of the game, and allows you to **reload** the game **at the exact location** where the save was made. 

With this system, there is no need to find a save point or start the games from the beginning **ever gain**! 

You can use so-called **"slots"** to save multiple "save states" for the same game. 

There are 10 "slots" per game and are numbered from 0 to 9. 


>* **Hotkey** + Y → Save \(in the current slot\) 
>* **Hotkey** + X → Load backup \(of the current slot\)
>* **Hotkey** + Up ****→ Select the previous slot \(-1\) 
>* **Hotkey** + Down ****→ Select the next slot \(+1\)
