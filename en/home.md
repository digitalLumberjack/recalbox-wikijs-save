This is the official documentation for Recalbox.  
We hope you find the answers to your questions.

## Recommendation for beginners

### I want to install Recalbox, which hardware should I use?

We have several lists on hardware compatibility in Documentation :

* [Compatible Boards](/hardware-compatibility/emulators-compatibility) : Lists the different boards on which Recalbox can be installed and their compatibility with supported emulators. 
* [Compatible PCs](/hardware-compatibility/compatible-pcs) : Lists PC configurations compatible with Recalbox. 
* [Compatible Devices](/hardware-compatibility/compatible-devices) : Lists some useful devices that have been tested and may or may not be compatible with Recalbox.



### I'm a beginner, where do I start ?

* We suggest that you consult in the Documentation :
  * [Description of the documentation](/).
  * the [Recalbox Manual](/basic-manual/getting-started), to understand the basics of how the operating system works.
  * You can also consult the [Emulator](/emulators/arcade) section for more information **on the emulators present in Recalbox.**
  * If certain **terms** seem **too technical** to you, the [Glossary](/basic-manual/glossary) can be a **precious ally**. 
* For some **specific configurations** :
  * Refer to the [Tutorials](https://recalbox.gitbook.io/tutorials/) section. 
* You can also consult for additional information :
  * **the Recalbox website** \([https://www.recalbox.com](https://www.recalbox.com)\).
  * **the forum** \([https://forum.recalbox.com](https://forum.recalbox.com/)\).



### Do you have any tips for a new user ?

**Recalbox** is an **open source** project and so **free** !

As such, the people who work on it do so on their free time.  
This means that it may have a few bugs or maybe not as "**plug and play**" as a full-fledged commercial product.

So **the best advice** we can give you is to **be curious, to read the documentation, the tutorials, the forum and especially to save** things before doing any manipulation \(the outcome of which would be uncertain for you\).
