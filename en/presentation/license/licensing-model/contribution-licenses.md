# Contribution licenses

On both software development and creative works projects, the usual "inbound=outbound" licensing scheme applies, unless stated otherwise.

As clearly explained in GitHub's [open-source guides](https://opensource.guide/legal/), it means that :

> An open source license implicitly serves as both the inbound \(from contributors\) and outbound \(to other contributors and users\) license.



Which means that by contributing to any of our projects, you agree to its license terms and that you submit your contribution under the exact same terms.
