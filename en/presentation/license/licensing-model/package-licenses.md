# Package licenses

Recalbox is built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/), which aggregates many software packages with different licenses and outputs a full operating sytem.

Each package is covered and protected by its own license\(s\) and remains the property of its respective author\(s\).

We are [currently working](https://gitlab.com/recalbox/recalbox/issues/727) on making [`make legal-info`](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#_complying_with_open_source_licenses)functional on Recalbox source code to give an exhaustive overview of all licences used by each package. In the meantime, we can only invite you to check each package license\(s\) manually.


>**Information :**  
>While some package licenses might be incompatible with each other, Recalbox is not considered a "derivative work" or a "modified version" of them, but a mere aggregate of them.
>
>As such, the virality of some licenses does not impact neither the license of other packages nor the license of Recalbox itself.
>
>See the [GPL FAQ](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#MereAggregation) for more details.
