## General troubleshooting

* **My Recalbox just crashed, should I unplug it and plug it back ?**

> No, in most cases, the system didn't fully crash, only EmulationStation did.  
> Here are multiple ways to deal with this situation, the easiest being the use of the webmanager debug functionnalities to either restart ES or to Shutdown Recalbox correctly.  
> Not doing so may corrupt your datas, especially if you're using a Raspberry Pi with an SD card.

## EmulationStation <a id="emulationstation"></a>

* **How to change the EmulationStation theme ?**

> Enter key on the keyboard or Start on the joystick â†’ Interface settings â†’ Theme \(at the very bottom\)

* **Where are the EmulationStation configuration files in the file system ?**

> /root/.emulationstation

* **Where are the themes of EmulationStation ?**

> /root/.emulationstation/themes

* **How to cut the music ?**

> Enter key on the keyboard or Start on the joystick â†’ Sound parameter â†’ Set to Off

## Emulation

* **Why are there multiple emulators for each system ?**

> Emulation is not a flawless operation, there is a balance between performances, features, and fidelity. Since emulation isn't perfect, it's better to have multiple options to deal with it, sometimes a faster emulator will be better but might have unexpected glitches, while a slower one might have an higher accuracy but won't support some specific features.

* **How to change the Default emulator for a given system ?**

> By pushing _Start_ on the gamepad, then going to _advanced settings_, then _emulators advanced configuration_, you can select the desired system, finally, you can switch the Emulator and Core settings \(Note that the Core setting won't change if the Emulator setting says Default\)

## Connectivity
