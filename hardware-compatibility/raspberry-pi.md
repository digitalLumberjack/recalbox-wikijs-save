# Raspberry Pi

### ! ! ! Under construction ! ! !

The Raspberry Pi has an ARM11 700 MHz processor. It includes 1, 2 or 4 USB ports, an RJ45 port and 256 MB of RAM for the original model up to 4 GB on the latest versions. Its BMC VideoCore 4 graphics circuitry can decode full HD Blu-Ray streams \(1080p 30 frames per second\), emulate old consoles and play relatively recent video games.



## Additional accessories required

* Power supply
