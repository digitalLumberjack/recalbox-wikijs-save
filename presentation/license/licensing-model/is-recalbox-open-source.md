# Is Recalbox open-source?

**Yes** ðŸŽ‰

The source code is [available on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/recalbox/recalbox) and we **welcome every contribution** ðŸ¤—

## Long answer <a id="long-answer"></a>

Recalbox uses an **open-source non-commercial** license.

The \(retro-\)gaming industry has seen numerous attempts of using unpaid work from volunteer developers to sell all-in-one products without their consent \(or even their knowledge!\) on cheap hardware with outrageous margins.

This is even more shocking due to the total lack of support given to ripped off customers and even worse: people selling those "turnkey boxes" often redirect their customers to the open-source project support channels ðŸ˜¬

Not to mention those boxes usually ship with gigabytes of copyrighted material \(_i.e._ game roms\) ðŸ˜±

This is why [many open-source projects](https://docs.libretro.com/development/licenses/#non-commercial) related to retro-gaming and emulation - including Recalbox - have adopted a non-commercial open-source license over the years.
