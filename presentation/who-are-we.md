# Who are we ?

## Introduction

An **open-source retrogaming console** ! The Recalbox.

The **Recalbox** allows you to play a variety of consoles and platforms in your living room with ease !

**RecalboxOS** is the **operating system** of the Recalbox project, a **ready-to-use** emulation console based on **Raspberry Pi** that is completely **free and open source**, and has been specially designed so that **you can create your own in no time**.

The Recalbox offers you a **wide selection of consoles and systems**, from the first arcade terminals to platforms such as the Playstation, the Nes and the Megadrive.

**RecalboxOS** uses several existing elements, such as [EmulationStation2](https://github.com/Aloshi/EmulationStation) as **interface**, [piFBA](https://github.com/digitalLumberjack/pifba) and [RetroArch](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch) as **emulators**, [Raspberry Pi NOOBS](https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs) as **installation/recovery system**.



**RecalboxOS** can be described with one word : **EASY**.  
We want to provide a system that is as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. No need to modify a multitude of configuration files or to connect in SSH.  
Just install the system and play.  
The OS configuration is done via a single file, named `recalbox.conf`.  
It allows a precise configuration of all the emulators !

But for **advanced users** who want to have a **more advanced configuration**, we have given them the possibility to make a system at their convenience with **overloads** \(modify only if you are sure of the result\).



### Dozens of open-source software... gathered in a single OS.

**Recalbox OS** is based on the **GNU/Linux** system.  
It includes hundreds of open-source software, from the smallest utility to its emulators and EmulationStation frontend.

Enjoy dozens of retroarch/libretro emulators, the famous Kodi Media Player, and the custom EmulationStation frontend !

### With homebrews and hacks. Discover games never before released on a console !

Homebrews are games created from scratch by developers. Many of them are very good surprises, and will make you have a wonderful time.

Hacks are modifications of existing games. They take all or part of the graphics and gameplay of a game, and diverge on the story, the difficulty, the atmosphere.  
Some are considered full sequels of the original games, such as Super Mario Bros 4 \(hack of Super Mario World\) or Legend Of Zelda - Parallels Worlds \(hack of A link to the past\).
