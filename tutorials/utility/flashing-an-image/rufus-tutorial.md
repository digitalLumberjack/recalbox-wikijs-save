# Rufus Tutorial

[Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie/)

Download the executable file and run it - no installation is required.

The executable file is digitally signed, and the signature must indicate :

* "Akeo Consulting" \(v1.3.0 or later\)
* "Pete Batard - Open Source Developer" \(v1.2.0 or later\)

### Notes on DOS support :

If you create a USB bootable disk with a non-US keyboard, Rufus tries to select a keyboard layout that matches your system language. In this case [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org/), which is the default selection, is recommended over MS-DOS, as it supports more international keyboard layouts.

### Notes on ISO image support :

All versions of Rufus, since version 1.1.0, allow the creation of bootable USB media from an [ISO \(.iso\) image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image).

If you don't have an ISO file, creating such an image, either from an optical disc or from a set of files, is easy. You can just use one of the many free CD or DVD burning applications, such as [CDBurnerXP](https://cdburnerxp.se/) or [ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/).
